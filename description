/**
 *First of all, thank you for using the Weather App we designed. Please review our teamwork.
 *Our group has designed a weather forecasting system with many functions, such as deleting and changing the weather, adding the weather, and suggesting behavior based on specific weather, etc.
 *When you run this program, what comes to your eye is the directory menu.
 *Like your Vehicle App, you need to add the weather at the specified time and place according to the instructions, and the records you add will be stored for subsequent deletion or query.
 *Next, you can choose whether to delete the original weather or add a new one according to your needs.
 *You can also update the temperature of the weather you have entered.
 *Moreover, You can enter a weather you added to get the schedule recommended by the system.
 *Then, when you no longer need to edit the weather, you can select option 1) to list the final weather record.
 *The above is the whole content of our Weather App.

/**
 *If there are any shortcomings or areas that can be improved, you can inform us through Zulip or WeChat.
 *If you are willing, we will modify and improve our App in time.
 *Thank you again for using our Weather App. We wish you all the best in your work and a happy life.
