/**
 *First of all, thank you for using the Weather App we designed. Please review our teamwork.
 *Our group has designed a weather forecasting system with many functions, as follows.
 *When you run this program, what comes to your eye is the directory menu.
 *Like your Vehicle App, you need to add the weather data at the specified time and place according to the instructions
 *The records you add will be stored for subsequent revision, deletion or query.
 *You can choose whether to revise, delete the original weather data or add a new one according to your needs.
 *Moreover, you can check all the weather at a specific time or in a specific region.
 *In addition, you can also list all the final weather you have entered so far.
 *What's more, you can enter a specific region and time, and you will receive a recommendation for behavior according to the weather data of the day.
 *The above is the whole content of our Weather App.
